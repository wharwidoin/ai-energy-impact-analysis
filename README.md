Analyzing the global energy impact of artificial intelligence using LLMs — insights from IEA projections, trends, and policy scenarios.

# ⚡ AI & Energy: Global Impact Analysis with LLMs

## 📌 Project Overview
As artificial intelligence (AI) adoption accelerates worldwide, its energy demand — especially electricity for data centers — is becoming a major concern. This project uses data and insights from the **International Energy Agency (IEA)** to explore how AI could reshape the global energy landscape.

Leveraging IBM’s Large Language Model (LLM), we extract key insights, classify energy vulnerabilities, and generate policy-level recommendations based on AI electricity consumption projections, energy source shifts, and emissions impact.
